      <li>4 Shallots</li>
      <li>6 Cloves Garlic</li>
      <li>3-5 Thai Peppers (to taste)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Thai Basil Leaves</li>
      <li>4 Green Beans</li>
      <h5>Seasoning</h5>
      <li>2 1/2 tbs Oyster Sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp Dark Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbs Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tbs Fish Sauce</li>
      <li>4 tsp Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 tsp White Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, let's chop up the shallots and chili. Cut the long beans into 1/2
        inch segments. Meanwhile, we can already pre-mix the sauce by combining
        all the ingredients together.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mortar and pestle, add in the chili and garlic and pound them. Get
        all their wonderful flavors and aromas out!
      </li>

      <li>
        Add oil to a pan and add in the garlic and chili, along with the
        shallots. Stir well. Add in the pork next and fry them for about 2
        minutes or until they are a bit golden brown. Flip them and cook on the
        other side and separate them in the meantime so they are all in small
        bits.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add in the sauce and the long beans. Toss well and cook for another 2-3
        minutes or so. Turn off the heat and add in the holy basil leaves last
        cos you do not want them to burn. It's done - enjoy with some nice
        steamed jasmine rice!
